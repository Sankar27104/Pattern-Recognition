# Pattern-Recognition
Welcome to the Pattern Recognition Experiments repository! This repository contains a collection of foundational experiments and implementations related to the field of Pattern Recognition. It is designed to help students, researchers, and enthusiasts understand and implement basic concepts and algorithms used in the domain of pattern recognition.

## Overview
This repository includes basic experiments and projects that cover essential algorithms and methods commonly used in pattern recognition. Each experiment is implemented in a simple and understandable way to provide clarity on the underlying concepts.

Pattern recognition is a crucial field in machine learning and artificial intelligence that focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data. The experiments here introduce you to practical ways of classifying, clustering, and analyzing data patterns.

## Contents
This repository is divided into the following core sections:
1. Implementation of Gradient Descent
   + A step-by-step implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm.
   + Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models, adjusting parameters iteratively to         find the best fit.
2. Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
      + Implementation of Linear Regression for a given dataset using Gradient Descent to optimize the model.
      + Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, and Gradient Descent is used to minimize the
        loss function by adjusting model weights.
4. Comparison of Classification Accuracy of SVM for Given Dataset
      + Implement Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a dataset and evaluate its classification accuracy.
      + SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification, which aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between           classes.
   + The experiment compares the performance and accuracy of SVM on different datasets.
5. IRIS Flower Classification using Pattern Recognition Models
   + Build an IRIS flower classification model using popular pattern recognition models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN, and others.
   + The IRIS dataset is a widely used dataset in pattern recognition, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers with four features and three possible species.
## Project Highlights
1. Gradient Descent:
   + Understand the fundamental concepts behind optimization algorithms.
   + Visualize the process of cost minimization with step-by-step plots.
2. Linear Regression with Gradient Descent:
